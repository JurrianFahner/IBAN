# IBAN
This project supports International Bank Account Numbers (hereafter: IBAN).

It can be used in projects where validation of bank account numbers is needed. 

The class Iban has also a method which is able to calculate the check digits. This method can be used to generate fake IBAN, for testing purposes.
